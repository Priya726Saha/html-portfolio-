<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>About Me

  I am Priya Kumari, a dedicated and enthusiastic Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at Government
  Engineering College, Dumka, currently in my 6th semester with a CGPA of 7.1. I am passionate about leveraging
  technology to solve real-world problems, with particular interests in app development, machine learning, and robotics.

  Throughout my academic journey, I have actively engaged in practical, hands-on learning experiences. I have worked on
  several impactful projects, including a Deepfake Video Detection System using Python, Machine Learning, and Deep
  Learning techniques, as well as a Smart Billing App developed in Java, aimed at streamlining invoice generation and
  payment tracking. One of my most exciting technical ventures was developing a Swarm Robotics project where I
  implemented decentralized coordination among multiple robots for efficient area coverage and object detection.

  My internship experiences have further broadened my technical and soft skills. At Lawazia Tech, I participated in an
  App Camp Internship focused on application development. Additionally, I completed an offline internship at Ardent
  Computech Pvt. Ltd. where I built an Android-based Smart Billing App, deepening my understanding of mobile
  technologies. My participation in Hackfest 2024 at IIT (ISM) Dhanbad, where I collaborated with a team to create a
  Churn Prediction model in a 36-hour coding marathon, helped me grow significantly in areas of teamwork, time
  management, and productivity under pressure.

  In addition to my technical pursuits, I have taken on leadership and community roles. As the Captain of the 4th
  Jharkhand Girls Battalion in NCC, I honed my leadership and discipline. I was the top-performing volunteer in the BIS
  Awareness Program at my college, with a record 65 interactions—more than double the required minimum—showing my
  commitment to outreach and public engagement.

  I thrive in dynamic environments that encourage innovation, learning, and collaboration. My hobbies include
  problem-solving, reading, dancing, photography, and journaling—activities that help me stay balanced and creatively
  inspired. I am currently expanding my knowledge in Data Science and Machine Learning, preparing to contribute
  meaningfully to the tech industry with creativity, resilience, and a growth mindset.</p>
